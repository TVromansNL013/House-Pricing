# House-Pricing
A forecasting system to predict house prices in the Netherlands

This project was done as a school exercise as part of my graduation year of Digital Business Concepts, at Fontys Tilburg, The Netherlands. As part of the course, Web Programming students could choose their project. My project consists of two parts: creating an algorithm and creating an interactive web interface for this algorithm. 

The files located in the folder Algorithm are used to create an algorithm in R by using the package Caret. The database that has been used to train the algorithm is developed with a web scraper. The web scraper was build by using the plugin Webscraper.io and meant to scrape the Dutch real estate site Funda. The web scraper was used to extract the data of almost 70.000 houses in The Netherlands spread across the country. 

The second part was creating a web interface. By saving the algorithm outcomes to an RDS-file it was posible to integrate the algorithm in R-shiny. R shiny was used to develop a basic web interface that can be used to calculate house prices in the Netherlands. The files located in the folder Web-App are used to generate the web interface for the algorithm. 

For further dervelopment a autamatic webscraper would be incluse so it is possible to use data that is up to date. Besides that it is important to develop a suitable user interface that is easy to use. 

The documents and source codes can be downloaded via the following link, unfotently the files were to big to upload.
